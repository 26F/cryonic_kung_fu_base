Ultra lightweight shader driven "game engine" for developing interactive games / applications for Linux.
It's really just a bunch of boilerplate code with the intention that it gives a clean enough starting point for developing 
games / interactive applications using pure C and GLSL on linux.

All assets used in this repo are my own including the sound effects and "music."

use:

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

To create dependency graph of project
sudo apt install makefile2graph
make -Bnd | make2graph | dot -Tpng -o makefile.png
